PEG.js Spec Suite
=================

This is the PEG.js spec suite. It ensures PEG.js works correctly. All specs
should always pass on all supported platforms.

Running in a browser
--------------------

  1. Make sure you have Node.js and all the development dependencies specified
     in package.json installed.

  2. Run the following command in the PEG.js root directory (one level up from
     this one):

       make browser

  3. Start a web server and make it serve the PEG.js root directory.

  4. Point your browser to an URL corresponding to the index.html file.

  5. Watch the specs pass (or fail).

If you have Python installed, you can fulfill steps 3 and 4 by running the
following command in the PEG.js root directory

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

and loading http://localhost:8000/spec/index.html in your browser.
