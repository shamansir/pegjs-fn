PEG.js Benchmark Suite
======================

This is the PEG.js benchmark suite. It measures speed of the parsers generated
by PEG.js on various inputs. Its main goal is to provide data for code generator
optimization.

Running in a browser

     this one):

       make browser

  3. Start a web server and make it serve the PEG.js root directory.

  4. Point your browser to an URL corresponding to the index.html file.
